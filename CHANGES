* mozharness/base/config.py (_create_config_parser): Allow for --ACTION to do the same thing as --only-ACTION.  Put in action OptionGroup.  Disable noop option.

* scripts/hgtool.py: New file.

* CHANGES: New file.

* TODO: New file.

* mozharness/__init__.py: Bumped version to 0.4.

* mozharness/base/script.py (MercurialMixin, MercurialScript): Moved to mozharness/base/vcs/mercurial.py.  Adjusted other files accordingly.

* mozharness/base/script.py (BaseScript.dump_exception): New function.

* mozharness/base/script.py (BaseScript.copyfile): Adjusted to use dump_exception and a tighter try/except.

* mozharness/base/config.py, script.py, scripts/configtest.py, test/*: Switched simplejson/json import order, as simplejson is faster.
